Here is some content.

```{r}

library(ggplot2)
library(gapminder)

p <- 
  ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess") +
  geom_point(color = "purple") +
  scale_x_log10(label = scales::dollar)

p

```

How about we add an image ...

```{r}

knitr::include_graphics("./IMG_0953.JPG")

```
